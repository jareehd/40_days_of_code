permutation operation 
            
        is_permutation(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin())   return type bool
        Return value
        true if the range [first1, last1) is a permutation of the range [first2, last2).
        O(n^2)

        next_permutation(s.begin(), s.end())
        Return value
        true if the new permutation is lexicographically greater than the old. 
        false if the last permutation was reached and the range was reset to the first permutation
        O(n)

        prev_permutation(s.begin(), s.end())
        return type
        true if the new permutation precedes the old in lexicographical order. false if the first permutation was reached and the range was reset to the last permutation.
        O(n)

HEAP 
        
        is_heap(v.begin(), v.end())
        Return type
        true if the range is max heap, false otherwise.
        comlexity   O(n)
